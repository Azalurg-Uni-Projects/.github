# My university projects 

**Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹** 

I decided to create some place to keep all projects I did during my University education. Feel free to dig in and inspire, maybe it will help with your job ðŸ˜‰. If you want to correct any of my mistakes just create a pull request, or if you have any questions just let me know.
